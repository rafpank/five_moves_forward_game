# five_moves_forward_game
A short game in which I have 5 moves in one direction. 
Each time I am supposed to have the chance to meet on the road:
A crate (60% occurrence)or NOTHING (40% occurrence).

The crates have different colours:
green - 75% gives 1000 points
orange - 20% gives 4000 points
purple - 4% gives 9000 pts
gold (legendary) - 1% gives 16000 pts

Remember:
- Clean code
- using self-describing variables
